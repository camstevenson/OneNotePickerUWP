# OneNotePickerUWP

This is a sample control that demonstrations the use of the Microsoft Graph API to enumerate OneNote notebooks,
sections and pages, with the ability to display the (HTML) rendition of the page (sans images, etc).

To use this sample, you'll need a App ID / Client ID, which you can obtain by going to:

https://apps.dev.microsoft.com

* Add a "Converged Application"
* Add a "Native Application" Platform to the new Converged Application
* Leave the Custom Redirect URIs as the default

The App ID / Client ID generated can then be plugged into the sample application for this project.

**NOTE**

This is a work in progress.  It ain't pretty yet.
